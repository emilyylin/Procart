# Inspiration
It’s not a surprise that in 2020 with multiple lockdowns and people at home, we saw a 75% increase in Canadian retail e-commerce spending from 2019.
18 to 34 year olds reported spending 48% more in 2021 due to boredom or in preparation for post-covid times while also reporting higher levels of concern for managing their personal finances, experiencing lost income due to pandemic layoffs, and worrying about increasing cost of living. <br>
<br>
Whether it’s due to the younger shopper’s nature for impulse purchasing or a lack of knowing where to start saving, it’s a problem that needs to be addressed.

# What it does
ProCart is a chrome extension that facilitates proactive budgeting, cart saving, and responsible online shopping.
## 4 key features:
All these features were planned and designed by ultimately trying to achieve the end goal of creating a seamless online shopping experience for users who tend to overspend or want to be more aware and responsible with their purchases. 
#### Smart Notifications
Patent pending :)
#### Saved and Shared Carts
This section was designed to alleviate pressure on users who can feel pressured to checkout. Procart gives them time to think before purchasing, potentially come back at a later date. This would also enable shared shopping experiences between friends, where everyone with access to the code linked with the specific cart could find and make edits.
#### Purchase History
A purchase history section was included to keep users aware of their spending habits & to have that information readily available. This is a next step, as we have not yet integrated our product with any banks.
#### Category Budgeting
Ideally, we would link our product with a budgeting app similar to TD MySpend, allowing users to visually see how much spending they have available to them by category based on the budget they’ve set for themselves.
